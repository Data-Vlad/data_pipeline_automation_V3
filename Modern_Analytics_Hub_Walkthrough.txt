          MODERN ANALYTICS & AI HUB: THE ULTIMATE DEMO GUIDE
================================================================================

This is a comprehensive, step-by-step script for demonstrating the full power of 
the Modern Analytics & AI Hub. It is designed to "show off" the system's 
capabilities, moving from descriptive analytics to advanced AI and self-healing 
data pipelines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Install Dependencies & Drivers**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    > pip install pandas sqlalchemy pyodbc openai plotly streamlit scipy scikit-learn faker
    *Ensure you have the ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server installed.*

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create or edit the `.env` file in the project root:
    - DB_SERVER=...
    - DB_DATABASE=...
    - DB_USERNAME=...
    - DB_PASSWORD=...
    - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... (Crucial for Text-to-SQL, Semantic Search, and Vision)

3.  **Generate the "Perfect" Demo Data**
    Run the setup script. This doesn't just create tables; it injects specific
    statistical patterns, anomalies, and text correlations that the AI is 
    programmed to find later.
    > python scripts/setup_demo_environment.py
    
    *Check Output*: Look for "🎉 Demo Environment Setup Complete!".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: GENERATE AI INSIGHTS (BATCH LAYER)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the demo, we need the "Batch AI" to process history, train models, and 
detect the anomalies we injected.

1.  Start Dagster:
    > dagster dev

2.  Open the Dagster UI (http://localhost:3000).
3.  Locate the asset group `analytics_ai` (or search for `run_predictive_analytics`).
4.  Click **Materialize** on the `run_predictive_analytics` asset.
    *   *Behind the Scenes*: The system pulls the last year of data, trains an 
        Isolation Forest model to find outliers, runs a Prophet forecast for the 
        next 30 days, and saves all predictions to the SQL database.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: THE "SHOW OFF" DEMO SCRIPT (UI LAYER)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Launch the Analytics UI in a new terminal:
> streamlit run analytics_ui.py

APPENDIX: DEEP DIVE TECHNICAL REFERENCE & LEARNING GUIDE
================================================================================
This section provides a technical deep-dive into the AI and Analytics concepts 
implemented in this framework. Use this to understand the "How" and "Why" behind 
the features.

Each section includes clear ASCII visualizations and simplified explanations 
to make abstract concepts easy to understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMs) & GENERATIVE AI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Concept**: Imagine a super-advanced auto-complete on your phone. It doesn't 
    just guess the next word based on the last word; it looks at the entire book 
    you've written so far to guess the next word perfectly.

*   **Key Components Simplified**:
    1.  **Tokenization (The Word Chopper)**: Computers can't read words. They only 
        read numbers. This step chops words into number chunks.
    2.  **Embeddings (The Map of Meaning)**: Every word is turned into a list of 
        coordinates (like GPS). Words with similar meanings (Dog, Puppy) are close 
        together on the map.
    3.  **Self-Attention (The Spotlight)**: When reading a sentence, the model 
        shines a "spotlight" on other relevant words to understand context.
        *   *Example*: In "The bank of the river", when the model reads "bank", 
            it shines a spotlight on "river" to know it's not a money bank.
    4.  **Feed-Forward Networks (The Filing Cabinet)**: After understanding the 
        context, the model looks up facts and patterns in its internal memory 
        (its "filing cabinet") to process the information.

    **VISUALIZATION 1.1: TOKENIZATION (Text to Numbers)**
    *Caption: The computer converts language into a format it can process.*

    [Input Text]: "The cat sat"
          |
          v
    +-----------------------------------+
    | TOKENIZER (The Chopper)           |
    | "The" -> 101                      |
    | "cat" -> 754                      |
    | "sat" -> 882                      |
    +-----------------------------------+
          |
          v
    [Output IDs]: [101, 754, 882]

    **VISUALIZATION 1.2: EMBEDDINGS (Numbers to Meaning)**
    *Caption: Mapping words to a 3D space (simplified).*

    +-----------------------------------+

    **VISUALIZATION 1.3: SELF-ATTENTION (The Spotlight)**
    *Caption: How the model connects related words.*

    Sentence: "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired."

    Focus Word: [it]
          |
          +-----> Looks at "animal" (Strong Connection: 90%)
          |
          +-----> Looks at "street" (Weak Connection: 5%)
          |
          +-----> Looks at "tired"  (Medium Connection: 40%)

    *Result*: The model knows "it" refers to the "animal", not the "street".

    Time 2: [My] [Name] [Is] [Bob]  <--- "Hi" fell off the edge!

    *Result*: If the conversation is too long, the AI forgets the beginning.

    **VISUALIZATION 1.8: HALLUCINATION (The Guess)**
    *Caption: When the AI doesn't know, it guesses confidently.*

    Question: "Who is the CEO of FakeCorp?"
          |
    [Database Check]: Empty (No knowledge)
          |
    [Pattern Match]: "CEOs are often named John."
          |
    [Output]: "John Smith is the CEO." (False!)

    **VISUALIZATION 1.9: PROMPT ENGINEERING (The Instructions)**
    *Caption: How we talk to the model.*

5. MULTI-MODAL AI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Concept**: AI that can see, hear, and read.

    **VISUALIZATION 5.1: IMAGE PATCHING**
    *Caption: Breaking an image into words.*

    [ IMAGE ]  -->  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
                    [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
                    [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]

    The AI treats each square (patch) like a word in a sentence.

    **VISUALIZATION 5.2: CROSS-ATTENTION**
    *Caption: Connecting text to image.*

    Text: "Find the dog."
    Image: [Tree] [Grass] [Dog] [Sky]

    | Total:           |
    |           $500   |
    +------------------+

    Traditional OCR: Reads "Total: $500" (Maybe).
    Vision AI: Sees "$500" is to the right of "Total:" and links them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS & OPTIMIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Concept**: The GPS for business. It doesn't just tell you where you are 
    (Descriptive) or where you are going (Predictive), it tells you which turn 
    to take (Prescriptive).

    **VISUALIZATION 6.1: THE OPTIMIZATION LOOP**
    *Caption: Climbing the hill to the highest profit.*

          (Profit Peak)

             /     \
    (Start) *       \
             \       \

    Step 1: Check slope. Go up? Yes.
    Step 2: Check slope. Go up? Yes.
    Step 3: Slope is flat. Stop. You are at the top.

    **VISUALIZATION 6.2: DIGITAL TWIN**
    *Caption: A simulator of your business.*

    [Inputs: Price, Marketing] --> [MATH MODEL] --> [Output: Predicted Sales]

    We use this simulator to test 1,000 combinations in a second.

    **VISUALIZATION 6.3: SENSITIVITY**
    *Caption: How fragile is the plan?*

    Plan A: Profit $100. (If costs rise 1%, Profit drops to $0). -> RISKY.
    Plan B: Profit $90.  (If costs rise 1%, Profit drops to $89). -> SAFE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. ANOMALY DETECTION (Unsupervised Learning)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   **Concept**: Finding the needle in the haystack.

    **VISUALIZATION 7.1: ISOLATION FOREST**
    *Caption: It's easier to cut a lone piece of cake than a piece in the middle.*

    Data:  [ . . . . . . ]           [ . ] <--- Anomaly

    Cut 1: [ . . . . . . ] |         [ . ]

    Result: The anomaly is isolated in 1 cut.
            The normal points need many cuts to separate.
            Short cuts = Anomaly.

    **VISUALIZATION 7.2: TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION**
    *Caption: Taking apart the signal.*

    [Total Sales]
         =
    [Trend (Going up)]
         +
    [Seasonality (High on weekends)]
         +
    [Noise (Random bumps)]

    If the Noise is huge, it's an anomaly.
