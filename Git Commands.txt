Make Your Changes: Make the code changes in the files for both repositories.

1.Commit to the First Repository:

Open the Git Changes window (View > Git Changes or Ctrl+0, Ctrl+G).
At the top of the window, you'll see a dropdown menu showing your active repositories. Select the first repository (e.g., data_pipeline_automation_V2).
The "Changes" list will update to show only the modified files for that repository.
Enter your commit message (e.g., "Fixed data quality check logic").
Click Commit All.


2.Commit to the Second Repository:

Now, click the same repository dropdown menu at the top and select your second repository (e.g., data_pipeline_automation_V3).
The "Changes" list will refresh to show the files modified in this second repository.
Use the same commit message for consistency.
Click Commit All.
You have now committed the changes to both local repositories. You would then push them individually as well.
