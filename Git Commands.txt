# Auto-Sync Watcher (`auto_sync_watch.bat`)
# ============================================================================

## Purpose
The `auto_sync_watch.bat` script is a utility designed to automate the synchronization of two local Git repositories. It performs two main functions:
1.  **One-Way File Sync**: It copies any new or updated files from a source repository (V2) to a destination repository (V3).
2.  **Auto-Commit & Push**: It monitors both repositories for any changes (including the files just copied) and automatically commits and pushes them to their respective remotes.

This is useful for maintaining a mirror or for migrating from one repository version to another while keeping both in sync with their remotes.

## How to Use

### 1. Configuration
Before running the script, you must configure the repository paths inside the file.

1.  Open `auto_sync_watch.bat` in a text editor.
2.  Locate the `CONFIGURATION` section at the top.
3.  Modify the following variables:
    - `set "REPO_1=C:\path\to\your\source\repo"`: Set this to the full path of your source repository (e.g., `data_pipeline_automation_V2`).
    - `set "REPO_2=C:\path\to\your\destination\repo"`: Set this to the full path of your destination repository (e.g., `data_pipeline_automation_V3`).
    - `set "INTERVAL=10"`: (Optional) Change the number of seconds between each check.

### 2. Prerequisites
- **Git**: The `git` command must be available in your system's PATH.
- **Authentication**: Your local Git repositories must be configured to push to their remotes without requiring a password each time. This is typically handled by the Windows Credential Manager (for HTTPS with a Personal Access Token) or SSH Keys.

### 3. Execution
- Simply double-click on `auto_sync_watch.bat` or run it from a command prompt.
- A console window will open and display monitoring status and any actions it takes (e.g., "Changes detected in Repo 1. Syncing...").
- This window must remain open for the watcher to continue running. You can minimize it.

### 4. Stopping the Watcher
- To stop the script, simply close the command prompt window that is running the watcher. You can do this by clicking the 'X' in the corner or by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the window.
