### COMMANDS###

git remote -v:(checks if your project is living on the internet and its permissions)
git pull: Grabs changes from the remote and immediately merges them into your local branch.
git push: Sends your committed changes to the remote repository.
git fetch: The "safe" version of pull. It downloads the data from the remote but doesn't change your local files. It just lets you see what others have done.
git remote add <name> <url>: Connects your local folder to a brand new online repository.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
### STEP 1: INITIAL SETUP (DO THIS FIRST) ###

Create a file named .gitignore in your project folder to prevent sensitive files (like passwords) from being uploaded.
Common files to list in .gitignore:

**** inside the .gitignore file
# Environment Variables (Secrets)
.env

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
venv/
*.egg-info/

# Logs
*.log
launcher-error.log
simple_ui.log

# Dagster & Project Data
dagster_home/
generated_sql/
backups/

# IDE settings
.vscode/
.idea/
**** inside the .gitignore file

-----------------------------------------------------------------
### DAILY WORKFLOW: SAVE & UPLOAD (PUSH) ###

Step 1: Check status (See what changed)
   git status

Step 2: Stage changes (Prepare files to be saved)
   git add .

Step 3: Commit changes (Save a snapshot)
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

Step 4: Push to GitHub (Upload to server)
   git push origin main
   (Note: If your branch is named 'master', use: git push origin master)

----------------------------------------------------------------
### FORCE PULL (OVERWRITE LOCAL WITH SERVER) ###

Use this to completely discard your local changes and make your project an exact copy of what is on the server.
WARNING: This is destructive and will delete any unsaved local work.

   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/main

-----------------------------------------------------------------
### ADVANCED: PUSH TO MULTIPLE REPOSITORIES ###

You can configure a single remote (like 'origin') to push code to multiple places (e.g., GitHub and a backup server) simultaneously.

1. Add your PRIMARY repository URL as a push target:
   git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/YourUsername/PrimaryRepo.git

2. Add your SECONDARY repository URL as a push target:
   git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/YourUsername/BackupRepo.git

3. Verify the configuration:
   git remote -v
   (You should see multiple lines for 'origin' marked as '(push)')

4. Push:
   git push origin main

-----------------------------------------------------------------
### HOW TO REMOVE FROM SOURCE CONTROL (VS CODE) ###

To stop tracking a project in VS Code (remove the "U", "M" badges and empty the Source Control tab):

1. Close Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the project folder in your computer's file explorer.
3. Enable "Hidden items" (View -> Show -> Hidden items).
4. Delete the hidden folder named '.git'.
5. Reopen VS Code. The project is no longer a Git repository.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
### TROUBLESHOOTING###

1. Fixing this error: error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Data-Vlad/data_pipeline_automation.git'
   A. cd /d "..."
   Goal: This moves your terminal into the specific folder where the code lives.
   Success looks like: The prompt line changes to show your folder path.
   B. git pull origin main --rebase --allow-unrelated-histories
   Goal: This forces Git to download the files from GitHub (the "origin") and merge them with your local "main" branch, even if they have completely different histories.
   Success looks like: A list of files being "unpacked" and a message saying Successfully rebased and updated.
   C. git push origin main
   Goal: Now that your computer is in sync with GitHub, this sends your local work up to the cloud.
   Success looks like: Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) followed by To https://github.com/...


2. Fixing any merging issues:

A. The "Emergency Brake"
Run these to stop any "frozen" processes.
git rebase --abort
git merge --abort

B. The "Safety Save"
Run these to save your current work locally before trying to sync.
git add .
git commit -m "Safety save before sync"

C. The "Smart Sync"
Run this to pull from GitHub while automatically choosing your files if there is a conflict.
git pull origin main --rebase -X ours

D. The Final Push
Run this to send your clean, updated work to GitHub.
git push origin main

How to run them all at once
If you want to save time and fix everything in one go, you can copy and paste this entire line into your command prompt:

git rebase --abort; git merge --abort; git add .; git commit -m "Safety save"; git pull origin main --rebase -X ours; git push origin main


3. Moving from the incorrect branch to correct branch (main our correct, master our incorrect)
   A. git branch -m master main
   B. git checkout main
   C. git branch


4. GIT REMOTE & INDEX Recovery errors:
   Use these commands if you see any of the following errors:
   fatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output (Usually caused by large files or a dropped internet connection).
   fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository (The link to GitHub is broken or missing).
   fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Step 1: The Connection Test
    Command:
    ping github.com
    What it resolves: Confirms if your computer can "talk" to the internet and GitHub's servers.
    Result: If you get "Request timed out," the issue is your Wi-Fi or Firewall, not Git.

    Step 2: The Remote Audit
    Command:
    git remote -v
    What it resolves: Shows you the "Origin" (the cloud address).
    Result: If this returns a blank line, Git has "forgotten" where your GitHub repo is. If it shows an old or wrong URL, the sync will fail.
    
    Step 3:
    Test the Git Health (Is the local repo corrupted?)
    Command:Since you got an index-pack error, some internal files might be half-written.
    git fsck
    What to look for: If you see "error" or "corrupt," we need to clean the cache.

    Step 4: The Corruption Clean-up
    Command:
    git gc --prune=now
    What it resolves: Fixes the invalid index-pack error.
    How it works: Git "Garbage Collection" (gc) scans for half-finished or corrupted files created during a failed download and deletes them so you can start fresh.

    Step 5: The Re-Linking (Repair)
    Command:
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
    What it resolves: Re-establishes the bridge between your computer and GitHub.
    Note: If it says "remote origin already exists," use git remote set-url origin [URL] instead to update the existing link.

   Step 6: The Handshake Test
   Command:
   git fetch origin
   What it resolves: Verifies everything is fixed.
   Result: If this runs without an error, your automated script is safe to start again.
   Summary of Resolution
   By running these, you are clearing the "trash" from your local database (gc), verifying your network (ping), and pointing Git back to the correct cloud storage (remote add).
